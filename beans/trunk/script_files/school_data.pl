Version 0.02

our $VERSION = '0.02';

use strict;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[drbean@sac FIA0033] school_data.pl -s 011 -l FIA0033 | sponge league.yaml

=cut

use IO::All;
use YAML qw/Dump LoadFile DumpFile/;
use Cwd; use File::Basename;
use Encode;
use Lingua::Han::PinYin;

my $script = Grades::Script->new_with_options( league => basename(getcwd) );
pod2usage(1) if $script->help;
pod2usage(-exitstatus => 0, -verbose => 2) if $script->man;

my $leagueId = $script->league;
my $semester = $script->session;
my $leagues = "/home/drbean/$semester";
$leagueId = basename( getcwd ) if $leagueId eq '.';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

UTF-16LE Windows files in ~/admin/$semester/$school/$leagueId.txt must be converted to UTF-8 by removing non-member lines, setting fileencoding to utf-8. Make sure the characters in 2-character names are not separated by a space.

Make sure that there is a sensible member in the members field before running the script.

The second character in the Chinese name is used to generate the pinyin password.
