Grades

This is a collection of scripts useful for the anal-retentive teacher grading students in a very particular way.

hwtotal totals the scores in the homework directory and stores them in cumulative.yaml. However you may want to convert the scores to percentages of an ideal score. hwtotal doesn't do this.

grades totals subscores for classwork, homework and exams and prints a report.

checkbeans identifies the sources of the classwork score that a student gets by virtue of being a member of a group and getting a group score.

beans adds points that a group has accumulated and are being processed, for addition to the group record.

classwork totals scores that students have gained either individually or as members of groups over the weeks of the course. The average score per week is 80/number of weeks, so the total average is 80.

cumulative. How is this different than hwtotal?
