=head1 NAME

Grades::Groupwork - A way of working as a team in a competition or school

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Grades;
	use Grades::Groupwork;

	my $grades = Grades->new( league => $league );
	my $classworkgrades = $grades->classwork;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A superclass for the various ways a group (as opposed to pair) can work together and achieve a result.

Grades' Classwork role delegates its methods to one of a number of approaches. Some popular approaches, or forms of curriculum, are subclasses of Groupwork, like Groupwork::Responsible, Groupwork::NoFault. Other popular non-Groupwork approaches are Compcomp, and Jigsaw.

Keywords: gold stars, token economies, bean counter

=head1 ATTRIBUTES & METHODS

=cut

class Groupwork extends Approach {
	use List::Util qw/max min sum/;
	use List::MoreUtils qw/any/;
	use Carp;
	use POSIX;
	use Grades::Types qw/Beancans Card Results/;
	use Try::Tiny;

=head3 classMax

The maximum score possible in individual lessons for classwork.

=cut

	has 'classMax' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Int', lazy => 1, required => 1,
			default => sub { shift->league->yaml->{classMax} } );

=head3 beancanseries

The different beancans for each of the sessions in the series. In the directory for each session of the series, there is a file called beancans.yaml, containing mappings of a beancan name to a sequence of PlayerNames, the members of the beancan. If beancans.yaml cannot be found, a file called groups.yaml is used instead.

=cut

    has 'beancanseries' => ( is => 'ro', lazy_build => 1 );
    method _build_beancanseries {
	my $dir = $self->groupworkdirs;
        my $series = $self->series;
        my $league = $self->league->id;
	my %beancans;
	for my $round ( @$series ) {
	    my $beancanfile = "$dir/$round/beancans.yaml";
	    my $file = -e $beancanfile? $beancanfile: "$dir/$round/groups.yaml";
	    try { $beancans{$round} = $self->inspect( $file ) }
		catch { local $" = ', ';
		    warn "Missing beancans in $league $dir round $round," };
	}
	return \%beancans;
    }

=head3 beancans

A hashref of all the beancans in a given session with the names keying the ids of the members of each beancan. The number, composition and names of the beancans may change from one session of the series to the next.
	
Players in one beancan all get the same Groupwork grade for that session. The beancan members may be the same as the members of the class group, who work together in class, or may be individuals. Usually in a big class, the beancans will be the same as the groups, and in a small class they will be individuals.

Players in the 'Absent' beancan all get a grade of 0 for the session.

Rather than refactor the class to work with individuals rather than groups, and expand some methods (?) to fall back to league members if it finds them in the weekly files instead of groups, I decided to introduce another file, beancans.yaml, and change all variable and method names mentioning group to beancan.

=head2 Grades' Cooperative Methods

The idea of Cooperative Learning, giving individual members of a group all the same score, is that individuals are responsible for the behavior of the other members of the group. Absences and tardies of individual members can lower the scores of the members who are present.

Also, grading to the curve is employed so that the average classwork grade over a session for each student is 80 percent.

=cut

class Cooperative extends Groupwork {
	use List::Util qw/max min sum/;
	use List::MoreUtils qw/any/;
	use Carp;
	use POSIX;
	use Grades::Types qw/Beancans Card Results/;
	use Try::Tiny;

=head3 payout

How much should be given out for each beancan (except the 'Absent' beancan) for each week in this session, so that the total score of each player over the session averages 80?

=cut

	method payout (Str $session) {
		my $sessions = $self->series;
		my $beancans = $self->active($session);
		my $weeks = $self->weeks($session);
		my $payout = (80/@$sessions) * (keys %$beancans ) / @$weeks;
	}

=head3 demerits

The demerits that week. calculated as twice the number of absences, plus the number of tardies. In a four-member beancan, this ranges from 0 to 8.

=cut

	method demerits (Num $week) {
		my $absences = $self->absences($week);
		my $tardies = $self->tardies($week);
		my $session = $self->week2session($week);
		my $beancans = $self->active($session);
		+{map {$_ => ($absences->{$_} * 2 + $tardies->{$_} * 1)} keys %$beancans};
	}

=head3 favor

A score of 1 given to beancans with no more than 6 demerits, to prevent beancans who were all there but didn't do anything (ie had no merits and no demerits) from getting a log score of 0, and so getting a grade of 0 for that week.

=cut

	method favor (Num $week) {
		my $demerits = $self->demerits($week);
		my $session = $self->week2session($week);
		my $beancans = $self->active($session);
		+{ map {$_ => ($demerits->{$_} < 7? 1: 0)} keys %$beancans };
	}

=head3 maxDemerit

The max demerit that week. achieved by the beancan with the most absences and tardies.

=cut

	method maxDemerit (Num $week) {
		my $demerits = $self->demerits($week);
		max( values %$demerits );
	}

=head3 meritDemerit

Let beancans with no merits, and no demerits get a score greater than 1, so the log score is greater than 0. Let beancans with 3 or more absences and 1 tardies not be eligible for this favor, but get at least 0. Let other beancans get the number of merits - number of demerits, but also be eligible for the favor, and get a score of above 1.

=cut

	method meritDemerit (Num $week) {
		my $merits = $self->merits($week);
		my $demerits = $self->demerits($week);
		my $maxDemerit = $self->maxDemerit($week);

		my $session = $self->week2session($week);
		my $beancans = $self->active($session);
		+{ map {$_=> $merits->{$_} + $favor->{$_} +
				$maxDemerit - $demerits->{$_}}
			keys %$beancans };
	}

=head3 work2grades

The work (ie merits - demerits) of the individual beancans for the week, as a percentage of the total work of all the beancans, determines the payout of grades, which should average 80 over the sessions of play. I was logscaling grades. I am now not doing that.

=cut

	method work2grades (Num $week) {
		# my $work = $self->logwork($week);
		my $work = $self->meritDemerit($week);

		my $totalwork = sum values %$work;
		my $payout = $self->payout($session);
		my %grades = map { $_ => $totalwork == 0? 0:
					( $work->{$_}*$payout/ $totalwork )
							} keys %$beancans;
		$grades{Absent} = 0;
		return \%grades;
	}

=head3 logwork

The points given by the teacher are log-scaled to prevent active students from taking all the payout, and the other students getting very low grades. There may be better ways of grading to the curve than using log scaling. The log of one point is 0, which results in a grade of 0 for that week for that beancan.

=cut

	method logwork (Num $week) {
		my $work = $self->meritDemerit($week);
		my $session = $self->week2session($week);
		my $beancans = $self->active($session);

=head2 Grades' GroupworkNoFault Approach

Unlike the Cooperative approach, GroupworkNoFault does not penalize members of a group who are present for the absence of other members who are not present or tardy. Instead the individual members not present get a grade of 0 for that class.

Also, no scaling of the grades (a group's merits) takes place.
